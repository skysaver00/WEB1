<h2>Web이란 무엇인가?</h2><p>The<strong><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" target = "_blank" title = "HTML의 정의">World Wide Web (<u>WWW</u>)</a></strong>,commonly known as <strong>the Web</strong>, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.</p>
<img src = "web.jpg" width = "80%"><p>The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser and are published by a software application called a web server. The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-existed the Web in some form by over two decades and upon whose technologies the Web is built.</p>
